# Regression Model for Diabetes Dataset

This repository contains code for a regression model trained on the Diabetes dataset. The model predicts a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after the baseline measurements.

## Dataset

The Diabetes dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains information about diabetes patients, including various physiological and demographic features. The dataset is included in the scikit-learn library.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`.
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the `regression_model.py` script: `python regression_model.py`.

## Code Structure

The code follows the following structure:

- `regression_model.py`: The main script that loads the Diabetes dataset, trains a regression model, and evaluates its performance.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python libraries and versions.

## Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:

1. Load the Diabetes dataset using `load_diabetes()` from scikit-learn.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` from scikit-learn.
3. Train a regression model on the training data (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression).
4. Make predictions on the test set using `predict()`.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared score.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): A measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): A measure of the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
- R-squared Score (R^2): A statistical measure indicating how well the model fits the data.
